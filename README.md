Topic: A New Business Plan; Second-hand market service platform with blockchain by applying JLINK's idea

## 1. Introduction - Reason why I am choosing this business

2 years ago, I had an experienced cheated on a unreliable seller in a mobile application, [bunjang](https://m.bunjang.co.kr/).
The amount of money was approxiamtely 2300 Chinese yuan. (400,000 won, in Korean exchange) 
A bunjang has a function for communicating in  potential buyer and seller when buyer wants to ask something related to the good that he is interested in. 
Buyer and seller, both need to log in their own personal IDs and PWs, especially by entering identification code in text messages to identify the ID by mobile phone number. 
Additionally, it is suggested to use a double-check function connected with link to [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search) to check whether your counterpart is recorded on the website by someone already having been transaction experienced before, so that you, the potentially be cheated on the same person, can be preveted by fraud.
However, in my case, there wasn't any records about the seller. 
After a while I reported to the police, this kind of fraud which is a transaction throught online is rarely hard to catch suspects. 
It is because the identified bank accounts and phone numbers are mostly fake. 
Therefore, I think **the main reason** of being cheated online transaction is one of the features of online market transaction, which is easily cheating others with **a faked identification**.

During this blockchain course, I highly encouraged to research about second-hand onlie market transaction to redesign origianl platform with blockchain system.

# 3. Blockchain in second-hand market

## 3.1 Increasing e-commerce fraud in second-hand market transaction

## 3.2 Blockchain companies in second-hand market
 
   - [Car Vertical](https://www.carvertical.com/)
     - to track a record on a used car before demanders buy
     - whey demanders search about VIN number, then they can reach on the information about car details, such as a maufacturer, model of the car, type of the body, production year, engine power, type of fuel, type of transimission, the country of manufacture
     - itself makes a rating on condition of the car

   - [JLINK](https://www.jlinkcoin.com/)
     - A startup in Online Second-hand market undertook by blockchain 
     - The main idea is to set up a **escrow** to guarantee payment and delivery 
     - None furtherer updated after 2018
     (further information later)
     
# 4. Current situations and alternatives to prevent online transaction fraud in second-hand market 

## 4.1 How to prevent online C2C resale fraud conducted by the two companies

   - junggonara
     - a top tier in second-hand industry in Korea 
     - recently, announced a new consulting contract with Actwo Lab under [peer](https://peer.com/), a blockchain startup, to enhance more efficient environment in online used goods transaction (ariticle from https://www.tokenpost.kr/article-4400)
     - a function provided to check counterpart's phone number and bank account linking into [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search)
     - it is only available to reach last 3 months or 6 months records
     - further records only available to police officer (not all information opened to everyone)

   - bunjang
     - announced a introduction of machine learning to show reports on [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search) (article from http://www.zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20181205141557)
     - which is called as bungjang security
     - to check the past transation records before purchasing
    
 ## 4.2 New solution with blockchain, applying JLINK's idea

I think for junggonara and bunjang to put an effort on reducing its transaction insecurity is a good idea to accelerate transactions in internent P2P second-hand marekt. It would be great opportunity to broadly go up the online second-hand market power. 

But, you may have several questions unsolved with this idea.

Hereby would be 3 cases of fraud which could be happened in online transaction.
  - A seller didn't send the goods in exchange for the transaction.
  - An item has been sent, but it is not what's on the contract.
  - A seller who has never cheated on a previous 'The Cheat' record, could be unreliable seller from this current transaction

To solve this problem, However, I think an application of blockchain technology can be adapted for using the characteristics of being recorded on the block and opened to anyone.

Therefore, to apply blockchain technology on second-hand market bussiness, I strongly recommend the two online second-hand market supplier, junggonara and bunjang, to consider an application of the main ideas offered by JLINK.

According to [White papaer](https://www.jlinkcoin.com/pdf/JLinkCoinWhitePaper.pdf) of JLINK, it has several features.
- A new payment, J coin
  - Jlink Coin overview

# 5. Conclusion
In my opinion, the blockchain idea implemented by JLINK is too hard to be realistic as a business model. It is because, firstly, to be adapted for international online transaction will be complicate for being applying on different country and in various environment. We live in global world, but the laws that can be acted are all different depending on the country and the situation.
Secondly, JLINK Coin system is quite unreliable with no exchange rate and transaction fee on its platform.

Nevertheless, online used goods transaction has been on a steady rise every year. it would become more active in the future.
I think to solve the security problem with blockchain is to become a game changer in this business.

By the way, there are no countries, including the U.S., to have any related laws that can detain suspects in online fraud.
In South Korea, also, it is limited to voice phishing techniques only to legalize online transaction fraud suspects, and there is no legal action against other frauds.
Only the current suspension system in Korea is required under the Consumer Protection Act, which applies only to telecom vendors, and the Special Act on the Prevention of Damage to Telecommunications Financial Fraud and Reimbursement of Damages, which is limited to voice phishing.

In conclusion, to solve the untrusty online transation problem, we need to implement to make related laws to prevent moreover online transaction fraud. 
After that, we can consider and research more about application of blockchain with this issue. 
Through this works by researching any related articles and papers, I realized that there are much more disadvantes for the buyers in second-hand market when they got fraud.
