# 2. White Paper: A New Business Plan: Blockchain in Second-hand market

## 2.1 Reason why I am choosing this business as a specific business idea
I had cheated on a unknown person online second-hand marekt when I wanted to buy a macbook retina 15 inch. 
The amount of money that I got cheated was approxiamtely 2300 Chinese yuan. (400,000 won, in Korean exchange) 
In my case, the transaction was proceed on the mobile application for only second-hand market which is called [bunjang](https://m.bunjang.co.kr/). 
It has a function for communicating in  potential buyer and seller when buyer wants to ask something related to the good that he is interested in and also can negotiate in the communication. 
Both buyer and seller need to log in their own personal IDs and PWs, especially by entering identification code in text messages to identify the ID by mobile phone number. 
Additionally, it is suggested to use a double-check function connected with link to [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search) to check whether you counterpart is recored on the website by someone already had been transaction experienced before, so that you, the potentially be cheated on the same person, can be preveted by fraud.
However, in my case, there wasn't any records about the seller. 
After a while I reported to the police, this kind of fraud, which is a transaction throught online, is rarely hard to catch suspects. It is becasue the identified bank accounts and phone numbers are mostly fake deposits. 
Therefore, I think **the main reason** of being cheated online transaction is one of the features of online market transaction, which is easily cheating others with **a faked identification**.
