Final Report of Blockchain and bitcoin taught by Professor, Jaehyuck Choi.
Topic: A New Business Plan; Blockchain in Second-hand market service platform

# overview

## 1. introduction - Reason why I am choosing this business - my real story being cheated online second-hand market => introduction
- I had cheated on a unknown person online second-hand marekt when I wanted to buy a macbook retina 15 inch. 
- The amount of money that I got cheated was approxiamtely 2300 Chinese yuan. (400,000 won, in Korean exchange) 
- In my case, the transaction was proceed on the mobile application for only second-hand market which is called [bunjang](https://m.bunjang.co.kr/). 
- (It has a function for communicating in  potential buyer and seller when buyer wants to ask something related to the good that he is interested in and also can negotiate in the communication. 
- Both buyer and seller need to log in their own personal IDs and PWs, especially by entering identification code in text messages to identify the ID by mobile phone number. 
- Additionally, it is suggested to use a double-check function connected with link to [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search) to check whether you counterpart is recored on the website by someone already had been transaction experienced before, so that you, the potentially be cheated on the same person, can be preveted by fraud.
- However, in my case, there wasn't any records about the seller. 
- After a while I reported to the police, this kind of fraud, which is a transaction throught online, is rarely hard to catch suspects. It is becasue the identified bank accounts and phone numbers are mostly fake deposits. 
- Therefore, I think **the main reason** of being cheated online transaction is one of the features of online market transaction, which is easily cheating others with **a faked identification**.

더치트와 중고나라의 협업, 그리고
더치트에 쌓여있는 누적 데이터를 활용하면서 
블로체인을 이용해 서로 거래 현황을 볼 수 있는 형태로 진화
(블록체인을 이용하면 변화할 생태계, 작성한 그림으로 설명)



비트코인 거래시, 블록형태로 기록되는 것처럼 누구에게 입금. 송금. 이 체인의 형태로 연결되고
만약 사기가 발생하면 < 불이행>

보이스 피싱에만 한정되어 있는 전기통신 금융사기 피해 방지 및 피해금 환급에 관한 특별법상 지금정지제도를 언급
