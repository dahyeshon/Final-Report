Final Report of Blockchain and bitcoin taught by Professor, Jaehyuck Choi.

Topic: A New Business Plan; Blockchain in Second-hand market service platform

## 1. introduction - Reason why I am choosing this business

- I had an experienced cheated on a unknown person in a mobile application, [bunjang](https://m.bunjang.co.kr/)
- The amount of money was approxiamtely 2300 Chinese yuan. (400,000 won, in Korean exchange) 
- A bunjang has a function for communicating in  potential buyer and seller when buyer wants to ask something related to the good that he is interested in and also can negotiate in the communication. 
- Both buyer and seller need to log in their own personal IDs and PWs, especially by entering identification code in text messages to identify the ID by mobile phone number. 
- Additionally, it is suggested to use a double-check function connected with link to [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search) to check whether you counterpart is recored on the website by someone already had been transaction experienced before, so that you, the potentially be cheated on the same person, can be preveted by fraud.
- However, in my case, there wasn't any records about the seller. 
- After a while I reported to the police, this kind of fraud which is a transaction throught online is rarely hard to catch suspects. 
- It is because the identified bank accounts and phone numbers are mostly fake. 
- Therefore, I think **the main reason** of being cheated online transaction is one of the features of online market transaction, which is easily cheating others with **a faked identification**.

     - whey demanders search about VIN number, then they can reach on the information about car details, such as a maufacturer, model of the car, type of the body, production year, engine power, type of fuel, type of transimission, the country of manufacture
     - itself makes a rating on condition of the car

   - [JLINK](https://www.jlinkcoin.com/)

# 4. Status and alternatives to prevent online transaction fraud in second-hand market 

## 4.1 How to prevent online C2C resale fraud conducted by the two companies

   - junggonara
     - a top tier in second-hand industry in Korea 
     - recently, announced a new consulting contract with Actwo Lab under [peer](https://peer.com/), a blockchain startup, to enhance more efficient environment in online P2P transaciton (ariticle from https://www.tokenpost.kr/article-4400)
     - a function provided to check counterpart's phone number and bank account linking into [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search)
     - it is only available to reach last 3 months or 6 months records
     - further records only available to police officer

   - bunjang
     - announced a introduction of machine learning to show reports on [The Cheat](https://thecheat.co.kr/rb/?mod=_search) (article from http://www.zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20181205141557&re=R_20190124123857)
     - which is called as bungjang security
     - to check the past transation records before purchasing
    
 ## 4.2 New solution with blockchain

I think for junggonara to put an effort on  is a good idea to extend the security in internent P2P transaction. It would be great opportunity to broad the online second-hand market power. 

더치트와 중고나라의 협업, 그리고
더치트에 쌓여있는 누적 데이터를 활용하면서 
블로체인을 이용해 서로 거래 현황을 볼 수 있는 형태로 진화
(블록체인을 이용하면 변화할 생태계, 작성한 그림으로 설명)



비트코인 거래시, 블록형태로 기록되는 것처럼 누구에게 입금. 송금. 이 체인의 형태로 연결되고
만약 사기가 발생하면 <불이행>

However, you may have several questions unsolved by this idea.

Hereby would be 3 cases of fraud which could be happened in online transaction.
  - A seller didn't send the goods in exchange for the transaction.
  - An item has been sent, but has not been sent.
  - A seller who has never cheated on a previous 'The Cheat' record, but who is trying to cheat on a current transaction.

To solve this problem
As in the case of j-link, cooperation between second-hand countries and Dutch should be established to guarantee payment.

+ 물건의 배송에 대한 블록체인은 가능하지 않음...
+ 거래 대금에 대한 블록체인만 가능..(블록체인을 실행화 시키면)



# 5. Conclusion
Online P2P transaction has been on a steady rise every year. it would become more active in the future.
Therefore, I think to solve the security problem with blockchain is to become a game changer in this business.
However, There are no countries, including the U.S., to have any related laws that can detain suspects in online fraud.
In South Korea, also,it is limited to voice phishing techniques only to legalize online transaction fraud suspects, and there is no legal action against other frauds.
Only the current suspension system in Korea is required under the Consumer Protection Act, which applies only to telecom vendors, and the Special Act on the Prevention of Damage to Telecommunications Financial Fraud and Reimbursement of Damages, which is limited to voice phishing.
Lastly, it is the first step to
